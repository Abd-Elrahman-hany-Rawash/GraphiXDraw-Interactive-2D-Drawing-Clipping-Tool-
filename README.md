# ðŸŽ¨ GraphiXDraw: Interactive 2D Drawing & Clipping Tool

This project is a simple graphics application built using **C++** and **OpenGL**, designed to demonstrate core concepts in computer graphics.

## ðŸ§  What the Project Does

The application includes:

- Drawing basic shapes like circles, rectangles, and lines.
- Handling transformations such as translation, rotation, and scaling.
- Real-time interaction using the keyboard and/or mouse.
- Visual demonstration of how objects behave in a 2D or 3D space.
- Basic animation techniques and frame updates.

The goal of this project is to explore the fundamentals of computer graphics programming and visualization.

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- C++
- OpenGL / GLUT
- Code::Blocks or Visual Studio (for building and running the project)

## ðŸŽ¯ Learning Outcomes

This project helped me understand how rendering works behind the scenes, how user input affects the scene, and how animation is implemented using timers and frame updates.
